If you ran `npm install` in this folder and got ENOENT complaining about missing `package.json`, that's because this project didn't have one.

Options:

1) Use this minimal package.json as a starting point. Edit `package.json` to add dependencies and devDependencies you need, then run:

```powershell
cd Frontend
npm install
```

2) Initialize a fresh package.json interactively:

```powershell
cd Frontend
npm init
```

3) If this frontend is created with a specific framework (Create React App, Vite, Next.js), regenerate the scaffold with the framework's CLI.

After installing, use `npm run start` or the scripts you added to begin development.

Tailwind CLI notes:

- If `npx tailwindcss init -p` fails with "could not determine executable to run", you can still use Tailwind by adding the config files manually (created here as `tailwind.config.cjs` and `postcss.config.cjs`).
- The CLI error often indicates NPX couldn't resolve a binary from the installed package. Running `npm install` (or installing `tailwindcss` as a dev dependency) normally creates `node_modules/.bin/tailwindcss` which `npx` uses.
- To try again after fixing npm/npx, run:

```powershell
cd D:\E-Commerce\Frontend
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Or use the manual config files provided in this folder and ensure your build tool (CRA, Vite, etc.) is configured to use PostCSS.
